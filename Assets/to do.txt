- platformer player X
	- death

- enemies
	-boss
		kills player
- task cutscenes
	- sometimes unclickable
	- sometimes unavailable

dialogue 
	- sprite can glitch out while talking

we need to make a dialogue box for real and game - different fonts and whatever

interact with objects to trigger cutscenes and be unclickable needs to have visible outline, needs to fail to be clicked and glitch out

all the animations need to be fixed - maybe folder of images.
