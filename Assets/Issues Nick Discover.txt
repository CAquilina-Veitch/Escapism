- Text messages in life scene 2 also require you to click messages twice before they glitch out (first time the original message is in front of the old)
- Phone appears to continue to vibrate occasionally after clicking the message (particularly after choosing a message)
- Phone continues to vibrate after you finish conversation
- Need to get friend icon and replace skeleton head sprite
- Bunch of glitches occured in LifeScene 6 messages (not sure if once off)
- Again it continues to vibrate when no new messages occur
- Life scene 10 + 11 waking up animation required

- Two lines of dialogue in GameScene 5 playing at same time again (two collider issue?)
- All life scenes have same dialogue, default to convo 1


REFINING
- Sometimes player sprite doesn't do the die animation when killed
- Also sometimes goes back to idle animation after death (as if respawning)
- Potentially have boss fight cycle happen faster??
- Walk cycle doesn't match walk speed
- Screenshot transfer on certain levels makes the screenshot not the same size as computer screen
- Lacks indication of where to go to talk to mum once tasks are done
- Some message icons go off the screen (e.g. LifeScene 6)
- after making bed it doesn't switch to neat bed (tested in life scene 4)
